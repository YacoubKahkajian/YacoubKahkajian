I converted the header bitmap to a responsive layout for the landing page, which allows the website to be viewed on a variety of devices without compromising its design. I also reworked the article carousel to make scrolling horizontally more natural on touchscreen devices.",

I am currently working on a version of this article that focuses on vegetarian and vegan options.",
